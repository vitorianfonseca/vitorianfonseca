# Hey there ✨💻

I'm Vitória — 19, dreamer, and currently a Computer Engineering student at Politécnico de Leiria. Just getting started on this tech journey, one line of code (and one cozy vibe) at a time.

## About me:

- First-year student with big goals and a love for learning 💡 
- I’ve already worked on a few small projects and coding challenges 
- Music helps me focus, and a warm drink is always nearby 🎧☕  
- I believe in learning by doing — and yes, sometimes that means breaking things 😅

## Fun facts:

- A cappuccino a day… keeps the bugs away (or at least makes them easier to deal with).☕️🌸  
- Most of my best ideas happen at the most inconvenient times (hello 3AM coding).  
- Once spent 30 minutes debugging... just to realize I forgot to save the file. Classic. 🤦‍♀️  
- My playlists are carefully curated to match every coding mood — from “focus mode” to “fix-this-now panic” 🎶
